            <p>Is Blogging Still Worth it in 2021?
                The phrase “worth it” can be very subjective. Blogging is something highly versatile, possibly beneficial for making money, business promotion, or simply to occupy your time. To be completely honest – the true value of blogging depends on the individual.
                
                1. Making Money Online
                
                There are many ways for blogs to earn money and today (more on this in my point #6), opportunities for the capable are even greater. Consumers today increasingly look towards influencers as a source of trusted information. Companies have realized this as well.
                
                Brands have shown their willingness to work closely with popular bloggers. For instance, Somersbys worked with Polish bloggers in their recent marketing campaign. The result was a success for both brand and bloggers.
                
                As another example of this WPX Hosting designated Matthew Woodward of SEO Bloggers as their ‘official mascot’ for product promotion. Your opportunities will lie in the niche you’ve chosen, as well as the strength of your audience.
                
                2. Business Promotion
                
                Many businesses make the mistake of thinking that a great looking official site is enough of a digital presence. However, evidence has shown that companies that blog get, on average, 55% more visitors and 434% more indexed pages in search engines.
                
                More indexed pages means a higher chance of ranking well in search, leading to greater traffic volume. The more visitors you have, the higher your volume of conversion will typically be. In fact, many B2B marketers are convinced blogging is the most important type of content online.
                
                3. Just for fun 
                
                Everyone needs a hobby and if you don’t take things too seriously, you can basically blog at no cost at all. There are a number of decent free web hosting providers, many of whom will even provide a free subdomain for use.
                
                Even if you want something that performs a little better, this can be achieved for under $100 a year. Not only can you share information to a wide audience, but there’s a high chance you will pick up supporting skills as well – image editing, SEO, and more.
